# Dexter Note Ankify

Dexter Note Ankify is a Python utility to convert Dexter Chua's Cambridge Mathematics Tripos notes into Anki flashcards, enabling efficient study and review of mathematical concepts and theorems using the popular spaced repetition software, Anki.

## Features

- **Automatic Extraction**: Automatically extracts definitions, theorems, and proofs from LaTeX source files.
- **Subdirectory Support**: Maintains the hierarchical structure of the notes in the Anki card decks.
- **Customizable Processing**: Offers parameters to customize the processing based on user needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python
- Latex (i.e MiKTeX)
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) installed with extensions:
  - [LaTeX Note Importer](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1199027445)
  - [Latex On-Off](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2083624459) (Optional - Temporarily disable Latex Rendering to allow smooth preview)
  - 

To create a clearer and more complete README that includes additional installation steps for the submodule and corrects a few misstatements in the usage instructions, follow this updated layout:

## Installation

### 1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the main repository along with the necessary submodules, which include the "cam-notes":
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/duydl/dexter_note_ankify.git
   cd dexter_note_ankify
   ```

### 2. **Install Required Python Packages:**
   Install the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To convert the LaTeX notes to Anki cards, run the script with the following command:

```bash
python parse_latex.py
```

### Optional Parameters:
- `--input_subdir`: Specify the subdirectory within "cam-notes" from which to process notes.
- `--output_dir`: Define the directory where the output Anki cards will be stored.
- `--long_vocab_count`: Define the threshold count for what is considered "long" content, which must be manually edited.

### Example:

```bash
python dexter_note_ankify.py --input_subdir IA_L --output_dir out --long_vocab_count 20
```

This command processes all `.tex` files in the "IA_L" subdirectory of "cam-notes", with a long vocabulary count threshold of 20, and saves the output in the `out` directory.

### Importing to Anki:

After generating the Anki cards, follow these steps to import them into Anki:

1. **Import the Template Deck**:
   - Start by importing the template deck `template\ðŸ“œ Cambridge Notes__Template.apkg` provided in the repository. This deck includes the necessary note types and fields that match the output of the script.
   - To import, open Anki, then go to `File` > `Import` and select the `.apkg` file of the template deck.

2. **Import the Generated Decks**:
   - Match the note type of the imported note type with the fields generated by `dexter_note_ankify`.
   - Import the `.apkg` files created by the script by going to `File` > `Import` in Anki and selecting the files from your `output_dir`.

### Generate PDF of Deck

```bash
cd draft
make FILE=IA_L/probability.anki
```

This command will render the pdf file of "IA_L/probability.anki.tex" into the `.pdf` folder.
